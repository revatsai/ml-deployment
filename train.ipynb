During that time, many collect unemployment benefits to offset the lack of income.\\n\\n\\\"We have that gap in the year where we have to rely on those funds,\\\" said Gordon Keech, a landscape manager at a West Michigan company. \\\"We work all year long, pay into those taxes out of every paycheck.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, Keech said it has been 11 weeks since he applied for unemployment this year, and he has not seen a dime.\\n\\nHe has been in the landscape business for eight years, each time filing for unemployment benefits during the off season with no issue. Typically, he said he is approved and has money in his account within a month.\\n\\nCurrently, his MiWAM account claims he needs to verify his identity, which he said he did seven weeks ago. He said he can not get a person on the phone from the Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) to complete the verification.\\n\\nKeech is not alone in his struggle. He said at the company where he works, 25 out of roughly 40 employees have not seen any unemployment benefits this season.\\n\\n\\\"It\\u2019s just saying I never registered for work,\\\" said Jacob Mulder, another landscaper. \\\"I registered for work on Dec. 10 and I've been waiting ever since for them to say I did. I have proof I did, and I\\u2019ve sent it to them over and over again.\\\"\\n\\nMulder also has successfully filed for unemployment benefits for the past five years. He said he has never experienced anything like it.\\n\\n\\\"I have another kid on the way,\\\" said Mulder. \\\"Trying to get ready for another kid in the household. So, it's kind of rough. Yeah, no income at all.\\\"\\n\\nBoth Mulder and Keech believe something in the system has changed this year, where they are dealing with more automation than humans checking their account.\\n\\n\\\"We can\\u2019t speak publicly to individual cases. Understand that each case is unique and can be complicated to resolve and UIA staff is working diligently to help claimants. Claimants should be sure to keep track of and messages in their MiWAM accounts and reply as soon as possible to requests for further information or to verify identity.\\n\\nWhen claimants call UIA Customer Service at 1-866-500-0017 they have the choice to use the call-back option to save their place in line. Claimants can also go to Michigan.gov/UIA to schedule an appointment \\u2013 either on the phone, in person at their nearest Local Office, or virtually \\u2013 to talk to a staff member who can help with their questions. Not all our appointments fill up each day, so customers should be able to find open slots to choose a convenient day and time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We\\u2019re competing with that same group, and its extremely difficult,\\\" said Keech. \\\"It\\u2019s setting the rest of us back that are only laid off two months of the year roughly, having to wait so long to receive any funds.\\\"\",\n          \"The Global Fraud Detection and Prevention Market was valued at USD 18. 24 billion in 2020, and it is expected to reach USD 48. 71 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 18. 19%, during the period of 2021-2026.\\n\\nNew York, Jan. 25, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report \\\"Fraud Detection and Prevention Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)\\\" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06221862/?utm_source=GNW \\n\\n The COVID-19 pandemic has led to people showing increasing curiosity regarding viruses, which has resulted in high-volume searches. Hackers are trying to misuse this interest by making malicious programs hidden in files related to coronavirus. \\n\\n \\n\\nKey Highlights \\n\\nMoreover, companies across various industries are experiencing increased operational and financial pressure due to the pandemic. This creates a heightened level of economic risks such as reduction in revenue and profits, loss of market demand, etc. These financial risks may lead to increased motivation toward committing fraud through manipulation of financial results, misrepresentation of facts, misappropriation of assets, among other fraud schemes. \\n\\nThe fundamental shift from physical cards, checks, and currency toward digital payments continue to transform the way consumers and businesses transfer value. Identity, security, and trust are fundamental requirements for payments, commerce, and finance, especially in a digitized economy. \\n\\nAccording to the Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2019, the consumer and retail sectors are being targeted at a greater frequency compared to other sectors. The report further adds that at least 73% of the organizations are anticipated to lose revenue in case of an attack due to the non-availability of services at critical times. \\n\\nConcurrently, a significant rise in the retail IT infrastructure includes POS checkout terminals, self-checkout units, information/web kiosks, PCs, and back-office servers. Thus, the increasing dependency on IT, ranging from wholesalers and distributors to manufacturers and suppliers, demands greater security for consumer data. \\n\\nEven with the increased awareness about cyberattacks and breaches, employees are falling prey to social attacks. As per Verizon\\u2019s Data Breach Index Report 2019, financial pretexting and phishing represented 98% of the social incidents. Among 93% of all the breaches investigated, emails continued to be the main entry point (96% of such cases). \\n\\n \\n\\nKey Market Trends \\n\\n \\n\\nBFSI Sector is Expected to hold Significant Market Share \\n\\n \\n\\nFraudulent activities in the industry have evolved over the decades. While it was previously limited to cheque frauds and wire frauds, with the growth of the cybersphere and the accompanying expansion of the cybercriminal realm, it has taken on more virtualized forms. \\n\\nThe increasing technological penetration, coupled with digital channels such as internet banking and mobile banking, is becoming prominent customer choices for banking services, making it a crucial need for banks to leverage fraud prevention solutions. \\n\\nFraud prevention and detection represents one of the biggest areas of concern for financial institutions and is likely to become one of the prominent drivers for IT spending. Moreover, online transactions fraud, insurance claim frauds, and card-related frauds have been increasing the usage of these solutions in the insurance and banking and financial services sector. \\n\\nThe potential risk of fraud has been one of the biggest in online payments, which is anticipated to grow in tandem with the availability of digital customer relationships, as more companies are now offering online payments. \\n\\nOut of all the industries, BFSI has been most prone to insiders/employees in terms of the types of fraudulent activities. There have been multiple instances where employees have been accused of fraud (for instance, PNB fraud in India). In order to prevent these, the industry needs robust fraud detection and prevention solutions. \\n\\n \\n\\nAsia Pacific region is expected to witness fastest growth during the forecast period \\n\\n \\n\\nAs emerging economies in the Asia Pacific are adopting digitalization, the risk of breach of customer data and data channels is increasing, due to which, utilization of fraud detection and prevention solutions isrising at a significant rate. \\n\\nBank debit and credit cards accounted for the most substantial fraudulent activities, mainly due to the rapid increase in e-commerce transactions. However, organizations are aware that they may face a similar threat in the future, due to which they are upgrading their systems to the latest available technology. \\n\\nAccording to Experian, a credit information company, India has the second-highest risk of fraud in a digital transaction, in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, the company stated that approximately 48% of consumers in the country experienced retail fraud directly or indirectly. As a result, retail companies, such as Amazon, Flipkart, and Limeroad, are expected to adopt the latest fraud detection and prevention systems. \\n\\nSingapore has imposed a strict regulation against data breaches. The country has levied one of the highest penalties in the Asia-Pacific region, worth about USD 1 million, in case of a data breach, in accordance with the country\\u2019s data protection provision. This will ensure that companies operating in the country have adequate provision for fraud detection and prevention provision, making an affluent growing market in the region. \\n\\nMoreover, in Vietnam, many frauds are being witnessed in the retail and telecommunication industries due to the increasing penetration of digitization and the Internet of Things (IoT). This is expected to propel companies to incorporate fraud detection and prevention systems. Thus, the aforementioned factors are expected to aid the growth of the Asia-Pacific segment of the market studied during the forecast period \\n\\n \\n\\nCompetitive Landscape \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is moderately fragmented, with few firms enjoying a small share in the market. The companies keep on innovating and entering into strategic partnerships to retain their market share. \\n\\n \\n\\nJanuary 2021 - SAP launched a new collection of services and software, offered as a single subscription product called \\u201cRise with SAP,\\u201d designed to assist customers with cloud migration and digital transformation initiatives. As part of the Rise with SAP announcement, the company said it is acquiring Signavio, a Germany-based developer of business process intelligence and process management tools. The Rise with SAP offering is built around SAP software and services, with S/4HANA Cloud and the SAP Business Technology Platform at the core, with the software available through SAP\\u2019s private cloud service as well as hyperscale public cloud platforms such as Azure and Amazon Web Services. \\n\\nFebruary 2021 - Experian launched a new version of its own fraud prevention platform, which is targeted at businesses that experienced high demand for digital services or were dealing with a bump in the number of online accounts. \\n\\n \\n\\nAdditional Benefits: \\n\\n \\n\\nThe market estimate (ME) sheet in Excel format \\n\\n3 months of analyst support\\n\\nRead the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p06221862/?utm_source=GNW\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Reportlinker\\n\\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

During that time, many collect unemployment benefits to offset the lack of income.\\n\\n\\\"We have that gap in the year where we have to rely on those funds,\\\" said Gordon Keech, a landscape manager at a West Michigan company. \\\"We work all year long, pay into those taxes out of every paycheck.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, Keech said it has been 11 weeks since he applied for unemployment this year, and he has not seen a dime.\\n\\nHe has been in the landscape business for eight years, each time filing for unemployment benefits during the off season with no issue. Typically, he said he is approved and has money in his account within a month.\\n\\nCurrently, his MiWAM account claims he needs to verify his identity, which he said he did seven weeks ago. He said he can not get a person on the phone from the Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) to complete the verification.\\n\\nKeech is not alone in his struggle. He said at the company where he works, 25 out of roughly 40 employees have not seen any unemployment benefits this season.\\n\\n\\\"It\\u2019s just saying I never registered for work,\\\" said Jacob Mulder, another landscaper. \\\"I registered for work on Dec. 10 and I've been waiting ever since for them to say I did. I have proof I did, and I\\u2019ve sent it to them over and over again.\\\"\\n\\nMulder also has successfully filed for unemployment benefits for the past five years. He said he has never experienced anything like it.\\n\\n\\\"I have another kid on the way,\\\" said Mulder. \\\"Trying to get ready for another kid in the household. So, it's kind of rough. Yeah, no income at all.\\\"\\n\\nBoth Mulder and Keech believe something in the system has changed this year, where they are dealing with more automation than humans checking their account.\\n\\n\\\"We can\\u2019t speak publicly to individual cases. Understand that each case is unique and can be complicated to resolve and UIA staff is working diligently to help claimants. Claimants should be sure to keep track of and messages in their MiWAM accounts and reply as soon as possible to requests for further information or to verify identity.\\n\\nWhen claimants call UIA Customer Service at 1-866-500-0017 they have the choice to use the call-back option to save their place in line. Claimants can also go to Michigan.gov/UIA to schedule an appointment \\u2013 either on the phone, in person at their nearest Local Office, or virtually \\u2013 to talk to a staff member who can help with their questions. Not all our appointments fill up each day, so customers should be able to find open slots to choose a convenient day and time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We\\u2019re competing with that same group, and its extremely difficult,\\\" said Keech. \\\"It\\u2019s setting the rest of us back that are only laid off two months of the year roughly, having to wait so long to receive any funds.\\\"\",\n          \"The Global Fraud Detection and Prevention Market was valued at USD 18. 24 billion in 2020, and it is expected to reach USD 48. 71 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 18. 19%, during the period of 2021-2026.\\n\\nNew York, Jan. 25, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report \\\"Fraud Detection and Prevention Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)\\\" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06221862/?utm_source=GNW \\n\\n The COVID-19 pandemic has led to people showing increasing curiosity regarding viruses, which has resulted in high-volume searches. Hackers are trying to misuse this interest by making malicious programs hidden in files related to coronavirus. \\n\\n \\n\\nKey Highlights \\n\\nMoreover, companies across various industries are experiencing increased operational and financial pressure due to the pandemic. This creates a heightened level of economic risks such as reduction in revenue and profits, loss of market demand, etc. These financial risks may lead to increased motivation toward committing fraud through manipulation of financial results, misrepresentation of facts, misappropriation of assets, among other fraud schemes. \\n\\nThe fundamental shift from physical cards, checks, and currency toward digital payments continue to transform the way consumers and businesses transfer value. Identity, security, and trust are fundamental requirements for payments, commerce, and finance, especially in a digitized economy. \\n\\nAccording to the Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2019, the consumer and retail sectors are being targeted at a greater frequency compared to other sectors. The report further adds that at least 73% of the organizations are anticipated to lose revenue in case of an attack due to the non-availability of services at critical times. \\n\\nConcurrently, a significant rise in the retail IT infrastructure includes POS checkout terminals, self-checkout units, information/web kiosks, PCs, and back-office servers. Thus, the increasing dependency on IT, ranging from wholesalers and distributors to manufacturers and suppliers, demands greater security for consumer data. \\n\\nEven with the increased awareness about cyberattacks and breaches, employees are falling prey to social attacks. As per Verizon\\u2019s Data Breach Index Report 2019, financial pretexting and phishing represented 98% of the social incidents. Among 93% of all the breaches investigated, emails continued to be the main entry point (96% of such cases). \\n\\n \\n\\nKey Market Trends \\n\\n \\n\\nBFSI Sector is Expected to hold Significant Market Share \\n\\n \\n\\nFraudulent activities in the industry have evolved over the decades. While it was previously limited to cheque frauds and wire frauds, with the growth of the cybersphere and the accompanying expansion of the cybercriminal realm, it has taken on more virtualized forms. \\n\\nThe increasing technological penetration, coupled with digital channels such as internet banking and mobile banking, is becoming prominent customer choices for banking services, making it a crucial need for banks to leverage fraud prevention solutions. \\n\\nFraud prevention and detection represents one of the biggest areas of concern for financial institutions and is likely to become one of the prominent drivers for IT spending. Moreover, online transactions fraud, insurance claim frauds, and card-related frauds have been increasing the usage of these solutions in the insurance and banking and financial services sector. \\n\\nThe potential risk of fraud has been one of the biggest in online payments, which is anticipated to grow in tandem with the availability of digital customer relationships, as more companies are now offering online payments. \\n\\nOut of all the industries, BFSI has been most prone to insiders/employees in terms of the types of fraudulent activities. There have been multiple instances where employees have been accused of fraud (for instance, PNB fraud in India). In order to prevent these, the industry needs robust fraud detection and prevention solutions. \\n\\n \\n\\nAsia Pacific region is expected to witness fastest growth during the forecast period \\n\\n \\n\\nAs emerging economies in the Asia Pacific are adopting digitalization, the risk of breach of customer data and data channels is increasing, due to which, utilization of fraud detection and prevention solutions isrising at a significant rate. \\n\\nBank debit and credit cards accounted for the most substantial fraudulent activities, mainly due to the rapid increase in e-commerce transactions. However, organizations are aware that they may face a similar threat in the future, due to which they are upgrading their systems to the latest available technology. \\n\\nAccording to Experian, a credit information company, India has the second-highest risk of fraud in a digital transaction, in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, the company stated that approximately 48% of consumers in the country experienced retail fraud directly or indirectly. As a result, retail companies, such as Amazon, Flipkart, and Limeroad, are expected to adopt the latest fraud detection and prevention systems. \\n\\nSingapore has imposed a strict regulation against data breaches. The country has levied one of the highest penalties in the Asia-Pacific region, worth about USD 1 million, in case of a data breach, in accordance with the country\\u2019s data protection provision. This will ensure that companies operating in the country have adequate provision for fraud detection and prevention provision, making an affluent growing market in the region. \\n\\nMoreover, in Vietnam, many frauds are being witnessed in the retail and telecommunication industries due to the increasing penetration of digitization and the Internet of Things (IoT). This is expected to propel companies to incorporate fraud detection and prevention systems. Thus, the aforementioned factors are expected to aid the growth of the Asia-Pacific segment of the market studied during the forecast period \\n\\n \\n\\nCompetitive Landscape \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is moderately fragmented, with few firms enjoying a small share in the market. The companies keep on innovating and entering into strategic partnerships to retain their market share. \\n\\n \\n\\nJanuary 2021 - SAP launched a new collection of services and software, offered as a single subscription product called \\u201cRise with SAP,\\u201d designed to assist customers with cloud migration and digital transformation initiatives. As part of the Rise with SAP announcement, the company said it is acquiring Signavio, a Germany-based developer of business process intelligence and process management tools.

The Internet and telecommunications provider blocked personal mobile hotspots of convention visitors and exhibitors who used their own data plans instead of paying Smart City's fees for Wi-Fi signals, the FCC said.\\n\\nA statement from Smart City says the company admitted no wrongdoing and wasn't found to have violated any laws as part of the agreement.\\n\\nSmart City President Mark Haley said the company has occasionally used technologies to prevent wireless devices from interfering with operations of neighboring exhibitors on convention floors and had no prior notice that the technology was unacceptable to the FCC.\\n\\nThe FCC says Smart City charged $80 to access the company's wireless Internet services for a day and automatically blocked users who didn't pay from accessing the Internet from their hotspots.\\n\\n\\\"All companies who seek to use technologies that block FCC-approved Wi-Fi connections are on notice that such practices are patently unlawful,\\\" Travis LeBlanc, chief of the FCC's Enforcement Bureau, said in a statement.\\n\\nInvestigators say Smart City also blocked signals at convention centers in Indianapolis and in Arizona and Florida.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7,\n          5,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
